            <p>The next Thursday evening came the white bear to fetch her. She got on his back with her bundle, and off they went. After they had gone a good way, the white bear said,</p>
        <!--insert text-block-1-->
            <p>&#x93;Just hold tight to my shaggy coat, and there's nothing to be afraid of,&#x94; said the bear.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text" id="t2">
            <p>She rode a long, long way, until they came to a large steep cliff. The white bear knocked on it. A door opened, and they came into a <a href="lark4.html"><span class="lark-link">castle</span></a>, where there were many rooms all lit up; rooms gleaming with silver and gold. Further, there was a table set there, and it was all as grand as grand could be. Then the white bear gave her a silver bell; and when she wanted anything, she only had to ring it, and she would get it at once.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text" id="t3">
            <p>Well, after she had eaten, and it became evening, she felt sleepy from her journey, and thought she would like to go to bed, so she rang the bell. She had barely rung it before she found herself in a room, where there was a bed made as fair and white as anyone would wish to sleep in, with silken pillows and curtains, and gold fringe. All that was in the room was gold or silver.</p>
            <p>After she had gone to bed, and put out the light, a man came and laid himself alongside her. It was the white bear, who cast off his pelt at night; but she never saw him, for he always came after she had put out the light. Before the day dawned he was up and off again.</p>
