            <p>Now when the time had come for him to return home, he had bought pearls and diamonds for the two oldest ones, but he had searched everywhere in vain for a singing, springing lark for the youngest one. This made him very sad, for she was his favorite child.</p>
            <p>His path led him through a forest, in the middle of which there was a splendid castle. Near the castle there stood a tree, and at the very top of the tree he saw a singing, springing lark.</p>
            <p>"Aha, you are just what I have been looking for," he said happily, then told his servant to climb up and catch the little creature.</p>
            <p>But as he approached the tree, a lion jumped up from beneath it, shook himself, and roared until the leaves on the trees trembled. "I will eat up anyone who tries to steal my singing, springing lark!" he cried.</p>

            <p>The man said, "I did not know that the bird belongs to you. I will make amends for my wrong and ransom myself with a large sum of money. Just spare my life."</p>
            <p>The lion said, "Nothing can save you unless you will promise to give me that which first meets you upon your arrival at home. If you will do that, I will grant you your life, and you shall have the bird for your daughter as well."</p>
            <p>The man hesitated, saying, "That could be my <a href="east2.html"><span class="east-link">youngest daughter</span></a>. She loves me the most, and always runs to meet me when I return home."</p>
            <p>The servant, however, was frightened and said, "Why must it be your daughter that meets you? It could also be a cat or a dog."</p>
            <p>Then the man let himself be persuaded, took the singing, springing lark, and promised to give the lion whatever should first meet him at home.</p>
