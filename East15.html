            <p>But now you must know that there were some Christians who had been taken there, and while they were sitting in their room, which was next to the prince's, they had heard how a woman had been in there, crying, praying, and calling to him for two nights in a row, and they told this to the prince.</p>
            <p>That evening, when the princess came with a <a href="lark12.html"><span class="lark-link tooltip">sleeping potion
                <span class="tooltiptext">
                    The prince said, &#x93;Pour the drink out next to the bed.&#x94;
                </span>
            </span></a>, the prince pretended to drink it, but threw it over his shoulder, for he could guess it was a sleeping potion. So, when the girl came in, she found the prince wide awake, and then she told him the whole story of how she had come there.</p>
            <p>&#x93;Ah,&#x94; said the prince, &#x93;you've come in the very nick of time, for tomorrow is to be our wedding day. But now I won't have the long-nose, and you are the only woman in the world who can set me free. I'll say that I want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it. She'll agree, for she doesn't know that you are the one who put them there. Only Christians, and not such a pack of trolls, can wash them out again. I'll say that I will marry only the woman who can wash them out, and ask you to try it.&#x94;</p>
            <p>So there was great joy and love between them all the night. </p>
