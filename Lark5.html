            <p>One day he came and said, &#x93;Tomorrow there will be a feast at your father's house, because your oldest sister is getting married. If you would like to go, my lions will take you.&#x94;</p>
            <p>She said yes, that she would like to see her <a href="east4.html"><span class="east-link tooltip">father
                <span class="tooltiptext">
                    she longed to go home to see her father and mother and brothers and sisters

            </span></a> again, and she went there, accompanied by the lions.</p>
            <p>There was great <a href="east5.html"><span class="east-link tooltip">joy
                <span class="tooltiptext">
                    such joy that there was no end to it

            </span></a> when she arrived, for they all believed that she had been torn to pieces by the lion, and was no longer alive. But she told them what a handsome husband she had, and how well off she was. She stayed until the wedding was over, and then went back into the woods.</p>

        <div class="text" id="t2">
            <p>When the second daughter got married, and she was again invited to the wedding, she said to the lion, &#x93;This time I do not want to be alone. You must come with me.&#x94;</p>
            <p>The lion, however, said that that would be too dangerous for him, for if a ray from a burning light were to fall on him there, he would be transformed into a dove, and would have to fly with doves for seven years.</p>
            <p>&#x93;Oh,&#x94; she said, &#x93;do come with me. I will protect you, and guard you from all light.&#x94;</p>
