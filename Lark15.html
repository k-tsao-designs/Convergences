            <p>But next day, when the wedding was planned, the prince said, "First of all, I'd like to see what my bride is fit for."</p>
            <p>"Yes!" said the stepmother, with all her heart.</p>
            <p>"Well," said the prince, "I've got a fine shirt which I'd like for my wedding shirt, but somehow or other it got three spots of tallow on it, which I must have washed out. I have sworn to marry only the woman who is able to do that. If she can't, then she's not worth having."</p>
            <p>Well, that was no big thing they said, so they agreed, and the one with the long nose began to wash away as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and scrubbed, the bigger the spots grew.</p>
            <p>"Ah!" said the old troll woman, her mother, "you can't wash. Let me try."</p>
            <p>But she had hardly touched the shirt, before it got far worse than before, and with all her rubbing, and wringing, and scrubbing, the spots grew bigger and blacker, and the shirt got ever darker and uglier.</p>
            <p>Then all the other trolls began to wash, but the longer it lasted, the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, until at last it was as black all over as if it been up the chimney.</p>
            <p>"Ah!" said the prince, "none of you is worth a straw; you can't wash. Why there, outside, sits a beggar girl, I'll bet she knows how to wash better than the whole lot of you. Come in, girl!" he shouted.</p>

        <div class="text" id="t2">
            <p>She came in.</p>
            <p>"Can you wash this shirt clean, girl, you?" he said.</p>
            <p>"I don't know," she said, "but I think I can."</p>
            <p>And almost before she had taken it and dipped it into the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still.</p>
            <p>"Yes, you are the girl for me," said the prince.</p>
