            <p>She grew sad because even that had not helped, and she went out into a meadow, and sat down and cried. </p>
            <p>While she was sitting there she thought of the egg which the moon had given her. She broke it open, and out came a mother hen with twelve little chicks, all of gold. They ran about peeping, then crept back under the old hen's wings. It was the most beautiful thing to be seen in all the world. Then she got up, and drove them across the meadow before her, until the bride looked out of the window. She liked the little chicks so much that she immediately came down and asked if they were for sale.</p>
            <p>"Not for money or property, but for flesh and blood. Let me sleep one more night in the room where the bridegroom sleeps."</p>
            <p>The bride said yes, intending to cheat her as she had done the previous evening.</p>

            <p>However, when the prince went to bed he asked his servant what the murmuring and rustling in the night had been. Then the servant told him everything â€” that he had been forced to give him a sleeping-potion because a poor girl secretly had slept in his room, and that he was supposed to give him another sleeping-potion tonight.</p>
            <p>The prince said, "Pour the drink out next to the bed."</p>
            <p>That night she was again led in, and when she began to relate how sadly she had fared, he immediately recognized his dear wife by her voice, jumped up and cried, "Now I am redeemed for sure. It is as if I had been in a dream, for the strange princess has bewitched me, causing me to forget you. But God has removed the spell from me just in time."</p>
